    <h1>BuzzFeed News Redesign: Research</h1>
    <p>The BuzzFeed News team and BuzzFeed tech team recently took on the task of rebranding our News arm. Other brands, such as Tasty and As/Is had successfully managed to branch apart from the classic BuzzFeed brand, but News was still quite closely associated with it, mainly from a visual and UX perspective.</p>
    <p>In the past, we argued that this worked in our favor (attaching the BuzzFeed & BuzzFeed News brand). However, <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/staff-buzzfeed-news" target="_blank">our reporters were breaking impressive and credible stories</a>, and ultimately we didn’t feel that the brand matched the quality of the work the team was producing. </p>
    <div class="clearfix xs-mb1">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="xs-col-12 md-col-9 xs-text-5 italic text-gray element-inset">The BuzzFeed homepage (first image) looked almost identical to the BuzzFeed News page (second image), barring some minor elements</p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix xs-mb4 md-mb5">
    <p>To challenge this hypothesis, our marketing & research team did a deep dive into how readers perceive BuzzFeed News. They partnered with Lucid, a data software company focused on market research and business insights, to better understand this. More specifically, they conducted a study to understand our competitive brand KPI’s, the perception between BuzzFeed and BuzzFeed News, social attribution, and different drivers of brand preference. </p>
    <p>The findings were interesting, yet not wholly unpredictable. The primary challenge we found ourselves up against was continually trying to balance trustworthiness and credibility with our unique and innovative editorial voice.</p>
    <p class="bold">There were a few high-level highlights:</p>
    <ul class="xs-mb3 xs-text-3 body-leading">
      <li class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">BuzzFeed News is not seen as a standalone brand.</span> News perception currently sits at “news articles from BuzzFeed” vs. understanding of “BuzzFeed News” as a distinct brand.
      </li>
      <li class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">Relevancy and entertainment does not always equal credibility.</span> BuzzFeed excels in entertainment and discovery metrics, but that isn’t translating into credibility for BuzzFeed News stories.	</li>
      <li class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">Online and social news lack distinction in general.</span> Consumer perception of online news is fuzzy between content aggregators (Google, Facebook, Twitter) and content creators (editorial news outlets) due to modern distribution methods.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix xs-mb4 md-mb5">
    <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt2 xs-mb1">The Opportunity</h2>
    <p class="xs-mb0">Concluding the market research, we drafted a formal problem statement:</p>
    <p class="italic">BuzzFeed News is not perceived as a premium and fully trusted destination for news by consumers and advertisers as the experience and design is arguably too tied to "classic" BuzzFeed. Creating a separate experience for BuzzFeed News (that is recognizably distinct from BuzzFeed’s entertainment content) will help position us within the broader landscape of other news outlets. Doing so will increase the perceived credibility of the brand and content.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="clearfix xs-mb4 md-mb5">
    <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt2 xs-mb1">Competitive Audit</h2>
    <p>Because the problem space was vague, we decided to dedicate time for research and distill down the areas to focus in on. To look at both traditional and non-traditional media spaces, we conducted a brief competitive audit.</p>

    <img src="/css/images/news-exploration/competitive-audit.png">
    <img src="/css/images/news-exploration/competitive-audit-2.png">
    <p>The market research helped us understand the “what”; that we’re not seen as credible or distinct. The audit, however, helped us to uncover some of the “why” to these two major themes. By looking at our competitors and matching those experiences up to the data from the research, we were able to pull out a few key points:</p>

    <h2 class="bold xs-mb2 xs-mt5 xs-text-2 sans-type">What makes a brand credible or trustworthy?</h2>
    <p class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">Transparent Journalism and Attribution:</span> showcasing editor beats and putting more focus on where journalists are reporting from, including surfacing documents to the public (e.g. a dossier, PDF embeds) and editorially curated content (“Editor Picks”)</p>
    <img class="xs-mt2 xs-border-lighter xs-mb1 xs-block xs-mx-auto xs-col-12 md-col-9" src="/css/images/news-exploration/intercept-citation.png" />
    <p class="element-inset xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-mb4">The Intercept freely cites their sources and links to them in a prominent way in order to promote transparency</p>
    <p class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">Awareness Over Time:</span> The New York Times and The Washington Post been around for decades. Other organizations like ABC and Fox News have a cable TV presence, alluding to awareness on multiple platforms. There also seemed to be a correlation between awareness and a “newspaper”-like design layout, alluding to print and traditional media
    </p>
    <p class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">User Experience and Content Adjacency:</span> Avoiding elements that dilute trust, such as 3rd party recommended content modules (Outbrain, for example), or disruptive and irrelevant advertising. Showing entertainment articles next to serious news also diluted trust.</p>
    <img class="xs-mt2 xs-mb0" src="/css/images/news-exploration/outbrain-module.png" />
    <p class="xs-col-12 xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-ml0">An Outbrain module positioned in close proximity to original news content</p>
    <img class="xs-mt2 xs-mb0" src="/css/images/news-exploration/buzzfeed-news-proximity.png" />
    <p class="xs-col-12 xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-ml0">BuzzFeed News content placed directly next to the less serious “classic BuzzFeed” content</p>

    <h2 class="bold xs-mb2 xs-mt5 xs-text-2 sans-type">What makes an experience feel distinct or premium?</h2>
    <p class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">Distinct Branding:</span> Custom typography, memorable logos and taglines, and a consistent art direction</p>
    <p class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">Innovative storytelling: </span> Consideration of sequential stories, interactivity, and custom treatments that reflect the narrative  </p>
    <img class="xs-mt2 xs-mb0 md-col-10" src="/css/images/news-exploration/nty-interactive-story.png" />
    <p class="xs-col-12 xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-ml0">An interactive NYT Magazine story</p>
    <p class="xs-mb2"><span class="bold">Editorial voice and content strategy:</span> Using a unique tone of voice that’s complemented by its user experience and visual design. Paying attention to how readers want to engage with content. A good example of this is Axios’ choice to highlight the most important content of the day and giving the reader a summarized version.</p>


  </div>

  <div class="clearfix xs-mb4 md-mb5">
    <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt2 xs-mb1">Design Sprints</h2>
    <p>We used those findings to fuel design sprints planned for the following weeks. The purpose of the sprints was to help drive ideation around the brand and its credibility.</p>
    <p>In order to represent the cross-functional teams involved, we included engineers, reporters, other product designers, and marketing folks in the sprints to capture each individual’s unique perspective. This was much briefer and more condensed than a traditional sprint. The agenda consisted of the prompt overview, idea generation, crazy 8’s, presentation, silent critique, and then discussion.</p>
    <p>We framed the exercise with these open-ended questions:</p>
    <ul class="xs-mb3 xs-text-3 body-leading">
      <li class="xs-mb1">What needs to be true in order for someone to feel connected to or affected by the news they consume?</li>
      <li class="xs-mb1">What makes an experience feel credible? What are the trust signals? </li>
      <li class="xs-mb3">What needs to be true in order for an experience to feel prestigious or premium? Worth their time and attention?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>  ...and used the following prompts to drive Crazy 8’s and ideation process:</p>
    <ul class="xs-mb3 xs-text-3 body-leading">
      <li class="xs-mb1">How might we convince a first-time user that we’re a credible news source?</li>
      <li class="xs-mb1">How might we foster an emotional connection through our everyday news articles?</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="element-inset xs-border-lighter rounded md-col-8 xs-mb5" src="/css/images/news-exploration/design-sprint-brief.png" alt="">
    <img src="/css/images/news-exploration/design-sprints-pages.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="element-inset xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-mb4">We executed crazy 8’s and ideating in a way that worked for both in-office and remote employees. A Google Slides deck was used to frame the exercise and we asked participants to take a picture of their sketches and paste them on a slide.</p>
    <div class="clearfix">

      <img class="xs-col-12 col md-col-5" src="/css/images/news-exploration/sprint-sketch-2.png">
    </div>

    <div class="clearfix">
      <img class="xs-col-12 col md-col-7 md-pr2" src="/css/images/news-exploration/sprint-sketch-4.png" alt="">
      <img class="xs-col-12 col md-col-5" src="/css/images/news-exploration/sprint-sketch-3.png">
    </div>

    <img src="/css/images/news-exploration/sprint-sketch-5.png" alt="">

    <p>A few reoccurring themes/ideas that came out of the sprint:
      <ul class="xs-text-3 body-leading">
        <li class="xs-mb1">Highlight our original reporting and showcase editors by building out reporter pages and giving bylines more context</li>
        <li class="xs-mb1">Invest in article previews and explore ways to tell a story in small, quick digestible pieces. Explore a TL;DR experience vs. a "lean back" experience</li>
        <li class="xs-mb1">Utilize more interactive or immersive ways to consume a story, specifically when it can compliment the narrative</li>
        <li class="xs-mb1">Enable inline comments and sharing functionality (what if you could highlight and share <span class="italic">any part</span> of an article?)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Because this was mainly for brainstorming ideas, we didn’t execute a traditional sprint or build prototypes based on these ideas. The brainstorm was, however, useful in influencing some proof-of-concept sketches that we could get in front of stakeholders. <span class="bold">The plan was to show the best ideas to stakeholders</span> (based on the themes and our hypothesis), <span class="bold">and then get out into the real world to test in front of users.</span></p>

  <div class="clearfix xs-mb4 md-mb">
    <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt2 xs-mb1">Presenting to Stakeholders</h2>
    <p>We brought our early research, opinions, and concepts together to present the different directions from the sprint to our stakeholders. Because we didn't have a concrete direction going into the meeting, we spent the majority of the time talking through the assumptions we were hoping to validate and our low-fidelity “proof-of-concept” ideas.</p>
    <p>The goal of the meeting was to get a conversation going and learn more about what our stakeholders wanted to get out of this project.</p>

    <img src="/css/images/news-exploration/stakeholder-preso-mocks.png" alt="">
    <div class="element-inset">
      <img class="col xs-col-12 sm-col-6 sm-pr4" src="/css/images/news-exploration/hp-proof-of-concept.gif" alt="">
      <img class="col xs-col-12 sm-col-6 sm-pl4" src="/css/images/news-exploration/bp-proof-of-concept.png" alt="">
      <p class="xs-col-12 xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-ml0">A few samples of the low-fidelity ideas we presented to stakeholders</p>
    </div>

    <p>When we presented our work, the stakeholders (the Editor in Chief and Director of News) weren’t completely blown away. There were ideas that they were drawn to, specifically around highlighting “beats” and reporters, but overall they were looking for a brand refresh rather than new functionality.</p>

    <p>They had a great point: <span class="bold">if we want to change how people perceive us, we need to start at the most obvious level – the brand layer</span>. They argued that shiny functionality and usability changes wouldn’t change our brand’s reputation or others' impression of BuzzFeed News, at least not from the start.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt2 xs-mb1">Narrowing Focus</h2>
    <p>Alas, all was not lost. We were able to use that meeting to distill down what <span class="italic">was</span> working and understand what our stakeholders valued:</p>
    <ul class="xs-mb3 xs-text-3 body-leading">
      <li class="xs-mb1"><span class="bold">Brand:</span> focus on a brand refresh and explore what will help us stand apart from the competition (and even to stand apart from the BuzzFeed entertainment brand)</li>
      <li class="xs-mb1"><span class="bold">Dynamic Layouts:</span> consider how we present the news, and how that might change based on what kind of “news” day it is (breaking news, social news, elections, etc)</li>
      <li class="xs-mb1"><span class="bold">Hierarchy and Information Architecture:</span> we recognized the need to clean up our information architecture, particularly around tags and categories. At the time, there were multiple ways to categorize and tag content, which posed negative effects downstream on our users. It was difficult to recommend relevant content based on what article the user was reading, because we weren’t confident in our taxonomy or tagging system. We also didn’t have a great way to highlight the different areas we were reporting on, such as Politics, World News, Tech, and LGBT news. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We felt that by improving the tagging system and taxonomy we could build an experience that allowed for better discovery and ultimately a stronger reputation.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt2 xs-mb1">Fleshing Out the IA</h2>
    <p>The tech team was under the impression that we would be working with a brand team, either in-house or with contractors, for the rebrand. This was the case for other launches at BuzzFeed, and it was something being talked about with Senior leadership. Because it was still up in the air, however, I chose to focus my efforts on what I was certain we needed – mapping out the contents of the News destination and the information architecture between BuzzFeed and BuzzFeed News.</p>
    <p>What components should the experience include? How do we arrange for them? How do they change based on what kind of news day it is? For example, how does the page change if we drop a major investigation? What about breaking news?</p>
    <img class="xs-mt5 xs-mb1" src="/css/images/news-exploration/news-contents.png" alt="">
    <p class="element-inset xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-mb4">Mapping the different elements to consider across the news experience, including types of mixed media and functionality</p>

    <p class="element-inset xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-mb4">How a page might change based on what kind of news day it is</p>

    <p>We also focused on cleaning up our taxonomy and organization. Despite from the multiple ways we're doing this under the hood (tags, BuzzFeed badges, and sections), we wanted to simplify the canonical tag experience for the user.</p>
    <img class="element-inset md-col-9 xs-mb0" src="/css/images/news-exploration/news-ia-feedback.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="element-inset xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-mb4">Basecamp was a great way to share ideas with tech and editorial teams</p>

    <p>Fixing our tagging system was also a win for reporters. Without needing to manual curate anything, we could effortlessly surface <span class="bold">packages of related content</span>. If a package showed up in the homepage feed, it could include a link back to the "parent" tag (or category) page for readers who were interested in more. For example, if our tagging worked properly, an editor could easily look at all pieces of content tagged “Women’s March” or “Pride 2018”, narrow it down to a few specific pieces, and then package those curated stories up to display on the home feed. This was something our editors had long been asking for, but had never been prioritized.</p>
    <img class="element-inset md-col-9 xs-mb0" src="/css/images/news-exploration/pride-package.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="element-inset xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-mb4">With proper and canonical tagging, we would be able to “package” tagged content and link to the parent tag page for readers who were interested in more.</p>

    <img class="xs-my5" src="/css/images/news-exploration/news-tagging.png" alt="">

    <p class="bold">After we came to a consensus around tagging and IA, we shifted to focus back on the brand. I've broken out the second part of this project, the visual identity explorations, into a separate case study, <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-16-news-rebrand %}">which you can find here.</a></p>
