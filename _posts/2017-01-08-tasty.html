    <h1>BuzzFeed Tasty</h1>
    <p>Last Spring, the BuzzFeed team set out to create a home for Tasty, <a href="http://facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty/" target="_blank">those bite-sized aerial food videos</a>, on the BuzzFeed website.</p>
    <img class="xs-block" src="/css/images/tasty-desktop.png" />
    <p>Over the past year and a half, Tasty has become a core driving force behind BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, with the majority of its content living and thriving on Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram.

      <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt4 xs-mb3">Defining the Problem</h2>
      <img src="/css/images/define-problem-sketch.png">
      <p>Although Tasty videos were successful, none of that success really existed on the BuzzFeed site.</p>
      <p>Users coming directly to the site and those coming through via Facebook weren't able to easily browse or discover Tasty videos on BuzzFeed's owned and operated platforms. This seemed like a missed opportunity, given the product's distributed success.</p>
      <p>What <span class="italic">did</span> exist before we embarked on this journey was a turn-key BuzzFeed "user page" retrofitted to display Tasty content. This original Tasty page spewed out a reverse chronological list of video links as a desktop-only experience.</p>

      <p class="xs-text-5 italic text-gray">Screenshot of the original Tasty page, using BuzzFeed's user page template.</p>
      <p>We knew that BuzzFeed-created content that performed well on Facebook performed (relatively) well on BuzzFeed. Due to this knowledge and to Tasty's success on our distributed platforms, we made the hypothesis that there was worth in creating a great discovery experience for Tasty on the site.</p>
      <p class="xs-mt4 bold xs-mb05">Goals</p>
      <ul class="xs-text-3 body-leading list-unstyled">
        <li class="xs-mb1">Improve the content discovery experience on buzzfeed.com/tasty</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="xs-mb05">Replace the existing reverse-chronological feed with an algorithmic feed</li>
            <li class="xs-mb05">Serve inline autoplaying videos directly in the feed</li>
            <li class="xs-mb05">Allow in-feed video sharing</li>
            <li class="xs-mb05">Create a valuable discovery and browsing experience, with search functionality as well as curated content opportunities</li>
            <li class="xs-mb05">Implement a fully responsive end-to-end experience</li>
          </ul>

      <h2 class="xs-text-1 xs-mt4 xs-mb3">Exploring Solutions</h2>
      <p class="bold">Hierarchy & IA</p>
      <p>The biggest question for the team at this point would be how we would organize the information. I started exploring with some different ways to present the content as we nailed down which aspects of the product would have the most valuable impact.</p>

      <p class="xs-text-5 italic text-gray xs-mb4">Desktop IA and hierarchical explorations</p>

      <p class="bold">Low Fidelity Explorations</p>
      <p>After playing with the IA a bit, we decided to push explorations that revolved around a top-of-the-page full-bleed image or "branding moment". We wanted to showcase the Tasty product and brand in a way that would pull in both advertisers and consumers. If successful, we'd allow advertisers to sponsor the page, just as an advertiser would sponsor BuzzFeed content (for example: <span class="italic">BuzzFeed Tasty, sponsored by Weber Grills</span>). Because this was a new objective, we approached the sponsorship idea as a long-term goal.</p>
      
      <p>Aside from this top branding/hero spot, we wanted to make sure the Tasty feed consisted of singular pieces of content (videos and posts) as well as packaged content (2 or more videos together). The singular content would solve for algorithmically-served inline videos, and the packaged content would allow for manually curated content in the discovery flow</p>

      <p class="bold">Diving Deeper with Content Packages and Playlists</p>
      <p>Towards the beginning of the project, we focused heavily on what we were calling “content packages”, which really just meant groupings of Tasty content. This could include things like “Tasty Junior” for kids, or “Proper Tasty”, which took a British spin on Tasty recipes.</p>
