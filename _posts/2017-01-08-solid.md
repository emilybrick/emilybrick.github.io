  <h1>Solid</h1>
  <p>About 3 months after I joined BuzzFeed, a small team of engineers and designers began building a CSS styleguide for the team's web products.</p>
  <p>The BuzzFeed design team the largest design team I'd ever joined, with around 12 designers at the time. Seeing the breadth of work was really interesting for me, from tools design to consumer products. But it was clear that as the design team and volume of work was growing, the consistencies across products were shrinking. Not only that, but newer parts of the site being designed clashed with the "legacy" pages, making the ecosystem kind of jarring for the end-user.</p>
  <p>When critiquing, we didn't have a good baseline for what patterns to use when, and when it felt right to introduce a new pattern, aside from gut hunches. Creating new designs and giving feedback on designs felt unstructured and ad-hoc. It was hard to get my footing as a new designer at BuzzFeed with no patterns or practices to draw from.</p>
